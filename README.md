# Earth Rotation Simulation Opengl

A brief one-sentence description of what your program does.

## How to Build and Run the Program

These instructions assume you have **CMake** and a suitable **C++ compiler** installed on your system.

### Steps

Follow these commands in your project's root directory:

1.  **Create a build directory and navigate into it:**
    ```bash
    mkdir build && cd build
    ```

2.  **Configure the build system using CMake:**
    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```

3.  **Compile the project:**
    ```bash
    cmake --build .
    ```

4.  **Navigate to the executable directory:**
    ```bash
    cd bin
    ```

5.  **Run the main program:**
    ```bash
    ./main
    ```

---

## Troubleshooting

* If the `./main` command fails, ensure the **`bin`** directory was created correctly during the build step.
* Check that you have the necessary **dependencies** (like CMake) installed if the first few steps fail.
